# Simplex
The program Simplex is able to detect and solves problems LP. You can model problems by using a Glade Interface. Once, introduced the data the Simplex is going to detect if has solutions or not. The program can solve:
- Solution / Factible
- Multiple solutions
- No bounded
- No factible
- Minimize or maximize
